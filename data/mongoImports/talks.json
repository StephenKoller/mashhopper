Web developers are creating in-browser templates and frameworks to help build these pages. Most of them look a lot like the server-side systems of old - HTML sprinkled with *place content here*. But what if there was a better way?\n\nD3 was created for data visualization - usually by creating SVG elements in the browser. The way it achieves this is by transforming data into a DOM. It has a declarative style that reduces the mental load on the programmer. By tying the data directly to its representation it enables transitions with little or no extra logic.\n\nHTML is not the goal of our template systems - the goal is a browser “document”. When our code lived on the server, HTML was the natural intermediate representation. But now that we are writing our software to run in the browser itself, we no longer need this middle-man.\n\nIn my talk I plan to explore client-side, data-driven page creation without templates by applying D3.

But how do you deal with legacy code in order to make you feel confident that it's testable and that your changes will not affect other parts of the application? It's a tough task, but this talk will show some practices and techniques to make you more confident with your experiences with working on legacy code.

In this half-day precompiler, we'll put our Rokus into developer mode and start uploading our own application code to them, from Hello World to basic streaming to more sophisticated content collections. Roku apps are all about getting the viewer to their content and then getting out of the way, and we'll see how the API is optimized for that, but also how you can \"go big\" and do some neat stuff if that makes sense for your application. This being a streaming device, we will also cover how to create the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) streams that Roku supports.\n\nParticipants will need to bring the following: 1. A Roku 2nd or 3rd generation unit (Roku LT, HD, XD, XS, 1, 2, or 3 should all work) with its power cord. 2. The original remote control (using the Roku smartphone app WILL NOT WORK). 3. Some means of seeing what's on the screen, either via a capture card into your laptop (preferred) or a second display.

This has led to a plethora of principles and patterns and laws, which are very valuable, but also easy to misunderstand and misapply.  In this talk we’ll go back to the foundations of Objects, and take a careful look at some of the more useful OO principles.  We’ll see how many modern frameworks force us into bad OO, but why occasionally that tradeoff is worth it.  When we’re done, we’ll have a more nuanced understanding of what good OO is, what it can do for us, and when we should use it.","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Kevin Berridge","Technology":"Languages","URI":"/api/sessions.json/OOP-Youre-Doing-It-Completely-Wrong","EventType":"Session","Id":"89203f0b-069e-4620-a875-606fb27e907e","SessionLookupId":"OOP-Youre-Doing-It-Completely-Wrong","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.json/Kevin-Berridge"},{"Title":"Open Your Mind to Erlang","Abstract":"Erlang is a functional programming language that was designed for high-concurrency, soft real-time applications. The original authors created Erlang for use in telecom devices which led to the creation of something that is different from any other language you use: completely functional with built in syntax for message passing between lightweight processes, designed to fail fast but with an application framework that deals with failure gracefully and with purpose.\n\nAs with anything new and different your first response may be fear and doubt. With its seemingly bizarre syntax and totally functional nature, Erlang seems unapproachable initially. It turns out that with a little bit of practice, the syntax begins to make complete sense and the functional aspects will open your mind to new ways of structuring your applications.\n\nIn this talk I will go through the basics of Erlang, explaining its syntax, providing code examples that show how to solve problems with functions, and talk about what Erlang is good at and what it is not so good at.

Compared to a traditional site with page refreshes for navigation and actions, single-page apps introduce complexity around state management, client-server synchronization and memory usage, and often increase initial page load time. Learn how to minimize the spinner and make your site feel responsive and continuous.\n\nInstead of focusing on a particular server or client-side framework, we will lay out pros and cons of strategies for serving assets, passing data, shared templating and code, caching and managing dependencies, referencing tools that can help along the way.

Do you spend your time wishing you could use Scala at work, but don’t see how you can get it approved?\n\nThere are good reasons to push for it! Scala is a popular language with Java developers because of its expressiveness and lack of boilerplate code. It allows you to focus on the problem rather than the ceremony required by Java. Yet, businesses are often reluctant to move to Scala, citing concerns about availability of developers and risks of working in a new language.\n\nLearn strategies for bringing Scala into your organization, including using it in non-production code, integrating Scala into a Java application, and easing your fellow programmers into functional programming. See how to use Scala for new development while maintaining your investment in existing Java code. Hear stories of how other organizations have done this and succeeded.

It’s fast, concurrent, distributed, but its Prolog-inspired syntax leaves much to be desired.  Ruby is beautiful and powerful, but struggles at scale and treats concurrency as a second class citizen.  Elixir - a young, functional, meta programming language - aims to resolve this mighty conflict by providing a rosy syntax inspired by Ruby that compiles to Erlang VM compatible bytecode.\n\nTogether we’ll take a guided tour of Elixir basics and functional programming concepts like pattern matching, pipelines and tail-call recursion.  From there we’ll explore the distributed and concurrent nature of Elixir, the fault tolerant nature of OTP, and leverage existing Erlang modules.\n\nYou scoff at the lack of angle brackets or curly braces?!  \"Where are my webs\" you ask?!

Although the language is mostly dead today, it drove the largest transformation of mainstream development tools since the creation of Unix 65 years ago.\n\nWe'll examine some key moments in JavaScript's history: its accidental rise to popularity; asm.js, allowing arbitrary software to run at native speed in browsers; the language ecosystem that grew up around asm.js, displacing JavaScript itself; the replacement of traditional Unix terminals, shells, and editors with new, higher-level equivalents running against the DOM; and finally, the inversion of the browser-OS relationship, still ongoing.\n\nThis story is told by someone who was a fervent JavaScript detractor during its rise.

Hopefully, we’ll all walk out with a few new items in our design toolkit, and an increased awareness (and wariness) of design conventions.","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Michael Boeke","Technology":"Design/UX","URI":"/api/sessions.json/UX-Antipatterns-Hidden-User-Traps-in-Sites-and-Apps","EventType":"Session","Id":"0e0951d6-8db5-4192-9e9b-65c8ad261716","SessionLookupId":"UX-Antipatterns-Hidden-User-Traps-in-Sites-and-Apps","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.json/Michael-Boeke"},{"Title":"Vagrant, the ability to think about production deployments from day 1 of development","Abstract":"Traditionally, developers would write their applications without any thoughtas to what system it was going to be deployed onin production. It was also very difficult for them to understand how their software would react when releasing itinto a production environment as they didn't really understand how that environment wasconfigured.\n\nWhat if there was a way that developers could create the scripts needed to install dependencies andget the software running as it is developed? Vagrant does exactly this, it is a tool to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. In this session, I will show you how to create a development workflow that will allow developers to use Vagrant to create a real continuous delivery pipeline. This means understanding the environment needs as well as what is needed to run the software.\n\nIn this session I will demonstrate how to start with anASP.NET MVC application and have the ability to create an Ubuntu environment to run this in production as well as how to run the same application in a Windows environment. Iwill also show how we, at OpenTable, integrate Vagrant into our pipeline to allow us to create a good acceptance testing environment against known datasets rather than having brittle tests.","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Paul Stack","Technology":"Development Methodologies","URI":"/api/sessions.json/Vagrant-the-ability-to-think-about-production-deployments-from-day-1-of-development","EventType":"Session","Id":"003c9e79-f97a-485f-813b-aa890b59d2c7","SessionLookupId":"Vagrant-the-ability-to-think-about-production-deployments-from-day-1-of-development","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.json/Paul-Stack"},{"Title":"Web Development with Python and Django -- FULL DAY","Abstract":"Get up to speed on web development with Python, the language that\n\"fits your brain,\" and Django, the web framework \"for perfectionists\nwith deadlines.\"  We'll strengthen your Python muscles by guiding you\nthrough the construction of a full website using Django that includes\na contact form, CMS pages, user registration, and CRUD operations,\nplus jumping-off points for further exploration.\n\nAttendees should bring a laptop with Python (2.7 or 3.3) and Git\nalready installed.

The presentation will explain the basics of Kanban and touch on a few more advanced topics.  We will see how Kanban is not a one-size-fits-all methodology, but rather a dynamic tool which through continuous improvement evolves to fit the needs of the organization.  We will look at some real Kanban boards, see how they evolved over time and discuss rationale behind the board changes.  We will look at an example of mixing Kanban and Scrum.  We will discuss lessons learned from 3 years of using Kanban; what has worked and what not.

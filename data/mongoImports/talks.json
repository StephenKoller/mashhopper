Contrary to popular belief, git is one of the most non-destructive version control systems available. When used right, git never loses any data, and even when misused, chances are very high you can still recover. This talk will present turn-by-turn directions on how to recover from a wide array of common git mistakes, and also provide some workflows to minimize them. Examples include, but are not limited to: * Changing spelling errors in commit messages. * Split commits into multiple commits with logical separation. * Combining multiple commits into one. * Resetting the base commit when you accidentally branch off of the wrong branch. * Recovering from merge conflicts. As well as more advanced topics, such as: * Extracting parts (e.g. sub-directory) of a repository as a new repository. * Merging multiple repositories into one while retaining version history. * Removing confidential data accidentally committed.",

The principles also guide you as you explore scaling beyond the team level, or when you encounter novel situations. When you leave this session, you will have done three things. First, you will explore the principles and their presence or absence in your team or company. Second, you will have identified activities or beliefs in the organization that either promote or inhibit agility of the principle. Third, you will have learned about some strategies for starting and sustaining change. Having done these three things in the workshop, you will leave with a framework to apply when you return to work and continue on your agile journey.",

Numerous small players are leap-frogging large players with lean tactics, such as minimal requirements, small cross-functional teams, iterative development, learn-as-you-go thinking, and more. â€œThe Lean Start-upâ€ is a proven phenomenon. But what if you are NOT a start-up? What if you are a large operation facing obstacles of complexity, compliance, current culture, and more? Using these strategies in the wrong context will make it seem like youâ€™re moving backwards--even leaving you longing for the way you were. The reality is: you need to navigate differently. But how? This session will focus on how you can incorporate best practices from the Lean Start-up world, and tailor them to fit your reality. Weâ€™ll cover proven lean principles learned over years of complex business application development that you can apply to your next initiative. Weâ€™ll address critical adaptations to the Lean Start-up model to allow for complexity and other common obstacles. You will learn actionable steps you can take on your initiatives--software related or not. If you follow our guide, you will be acting more like a Start-up in no time. Learning Goals: Participants will be able to: Identify what an effective Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is for a complex effort and how it differs from the more typical Start-up effort. Learn to plan initiatives differently, focusing on priorities that maximize learning and business value. Apply methods to make quick improvements and optimize efforts--while still operating within the realities of complexity, compliance, and current culture. Identify areas today where they can start to act more like a Start-up.",

      "description":"Tired of working alone? Sick of the same partner? Be ashamed no more! Pairing promiscuity is one of the healthiest activities a team can employ. Pairing with many different people promotes knowledge transfer and understanding across the team. It's the most natural way of setting up teaching / learning environments to stimulate growth. Learn the business value of switching pair partners and how it can to provide project management flexibility and overcome the perils of \"towers of knowledge.\" More than just repairing frequently, learn how pairing works for many roles beyond the discipline of programming. It can work for designers, quality assurance and project management, too. Even more exciting is that it works cross functionally. Pairing a designer and programmer together can cause all sorts of new and fascinating avenues to explore. This workshop will explore how successful pairing works across all roles as well as covering how to be properly promiscuous. The participants will actively engage in activities to discover the true power of pairing promiscuously and understands better how they can apply these processes to their own work environment.",

What do you do when you donâ€™t have a mandate, but still want to improve things for yourself and others? This session will introduce practical techniques that you can use in your organization tomorrow. We will show you ways to work with the existing company culture to change it from inside, ways to help others accept change, and especially ways that you can change yourself (sorry, we didnâ€™t say this would be painless). These techniques work whether or not introducing change is part of your job description. You canâ€™t change everything all at once, but you can change one thing, and then another, until everything is shaken, not stirred!",

      "description":"In most organizations, developers may review each otherâ€™s code, product managers may review each otherâ€™s stories and quality teams may review each otherâ€™s test plans. But what if the extended team reviewed these materials cross-functionally so that quality teams reviewed (or at least had visibility into) user stories â€“ and testers saw user stories? In todayâ€™s fast-paced Agile world, teams have to collaborate in order to be successful. Mark Hammer describes how peer review practices can succeed where more cumbersome methods fail. He uses concrete examples of teams that have embraced cross-functional peer review of user stories, code and test plans in an Agile environment, and how this has resulted in higher quality products developed faster. Mark offers tips on the mechanics of tool-based code reviews and compares five common styles of review, presenting research from Karl Wiegers, Frank W. Blakely, Mark E. Boles and others. He also looks at real-world examples including that of a customer who made the changes the research suggests, and reveals results, which are impressive. Attendees leave with an understanding of how cross-functional peer review can improve the performance of individual members of the extended product development team, including product management and testing team as well as their teams.",

Doing so will allow us to create products and services that will provide pleasure, flow, and meaning.

      "description":"As companies continue to grow into their agile capabilities, the speed of development continues to grow. Development teams have mastered the art of Continuous Integration and are trying to break down the doors to Continuous Deliveryâ€¦ but Operations teams hold the keys! Today, when a deployment fails it usually results in several emails and phone calls between development and operations. What failed? Where are the logs? On what machine(s)? Who approved this deployment? Why didn't we catch this problem earlier? These are the typical questions that get asked and lets face it, rarely does anyone have the answers. Time is wasted, systems are down, and fingers are being pointed. These headaches are easy to avoid. DevOps is an approach at bridging the gap between development and operations. For continuous delivery to be successful into secure production environments many aspects need to be accounted for besides simply deploying builds. Application configuration, environment configuration, topology differences among environments all present challenges in releasing quality software on time. In this talk we will cover: - What is DevOps, and how did we get here? - Pushing the quality metric. - Common enterprise patterns that DevOps can solve - PaaS: Scaling for the future",

In this session we'll examine common patterns of unintended consequences that stem simply from the language we use to describe changes to the way we work. You'll leave with a new model for thinking about language and using it to better effect. We'll discuss and practice the use of metaphor, mindset and specific practices to create shared understand in and between teams.

Agile solution delivery is a team sport and QA needs to be a contributing member from the start. Join us as some Software Engineering Leaders and a QA Leader debate how best to evolve and integrate QA with an agile team. With a traditional project, some events occur in sequence, but with agile, many once segregated responsibilities are now owned by the team and executed as a team. The agile approach is evolving and so too, is how QA participates on an agile team. Many QA concerns and tasks are still the sole responsibility of QA, however, depending on a teams â€œDefinition of Doneâ€, many concerns and tasks may be absorbed and owned by the whole team. In order to become a contributing member of an agile team, QA skills may need to be expanded. Deep technical and development skills make QA a more powerful team contributor and helps to socialize the role of QA into the team as a whole. This socialization of QA relieves some bottlenecks that have existed on traditional teams and opens up the possibility for increased velocity for the team as a whole. The role continues to evolve, and with it, the possibilities for how solutions will be delivered in the future.",

While the initial scope of the internal coaching team was the IT group, we'll show you how we were able to spread influence to other areas of the organization including the PMO, HR, Learning and Performance (L&P) and Change Management departments despite the additional constraints that come along with working in a government organization. In a year we've been able to migrate the entire 280 person IT group to Agile, added Agile training curriculum to the official leadership program through HR, helped transform the PMO, and develop technical capability to better support delivery of software. We'll show you the progress we've made and the process we used to get there. Some of the topics we will touch: * Transformation using Lean Startup â€“ created a home-grown change management method called Lean Change (http://www.leanchange.org) * Contractors and Internal coaches â€“ The difference in approach and results * Culture Hacking - How small hacks that run against the 'cultural norms' yielded high gains * How to change areas where you lack control by establishing relationships * How we used classic change management tools like ADKAR * How to manage the managers during a Transformation â€“ including our own * Ourâ€™s bigger! (the Kanban Board off course) - lots of pictures (of boards, change canvases, metrics, games, etc) , * What keeps on giving â€“ some areas where a little change goes a long way, * How a team of coaches can work - and be aligned * How we branched out of IT and into HR, Learning/Performance groups and got Management 3.0 on the official leadership curriculum * How we used Innovation Games to help people confused with their...",

Fear often holds us back from achieving the success we have always wanted, both personally and professionally. Improvisors deal with fear all the time. No script, no set, no props, no idea whatâ€™s going to happen next. Weâ€™ll examine the core of Improv and the core of Agile to see the similarities they share and how they both work to combat fear. We'll dive into the Agile manifesto to discover what fears might be manifesting themselves as resistance to Agile and what you can do about it. Iâ€™ll take you through some of my stories of working with Agile teams, what they have been afraid of and how we handled it. Iâ€™ll also share my personal story of following my own fear. Weâ€™ll get on our feet and learn some of the techniques Improvisors use and get ourselves into some uncomfortable situations in order to find our edge. I'll show you an exercise you can do yourself or with your teams that will help you focus on actually doing the things you've always wanted to do. You will learn: Why people are afraid of Agile Improv is all about dealing with fear and so is Agile What you can do to help yourself and your teams deal with fear",

They build burn-up charts to track it over time and make it the focus of much of their discussion during Sprint Planning and Retrospectives. Is the strong focus on this metric truly in line with the principles of Agile Software Development? Join Cheezy and Ardita as they lead us through a hands on workshop to explore this question. In this workshop you will discover how a focus on Value first, instead of Velocity, changes how the team approaches the work to be completed. Through a series of structured activities you will work with a Story Map for a fictitious project and assign value to the discovered stories. You will learn the practices and skills necessary to track Earned Value on your project and also learn the valuable lesson on how to discover what not to build. The outcome will be a set of new skills that you can take back with you and immediately apply to your current team development planning efforts. This session will be fun and educational.

Different ways of processing and sharing information can lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding. It doesn't have to be that way. While it's true that we're different, we're different in predictable ways. This session shines a spotlight on patterns of communication and encourages a conscious and strategic approach to conversations. You'll explore four basic communication styles, determine how your own style differs from the other three and discover techniques to overcome those differences so you can connect and be understood. With its foundation in psychological principles, itâ€™s a lighthearted yet practical look at human conversation and a powerful communication tool that can improve your relationships at work and in life. In this interactive session, you'll learn to: - Recognize individual differences in communication style. - Identify your own style. - Uncover the characteristics of each style, to identify the folks you interact with. - Develop strategies to interact productively with people whose styles differ from your own. Join us to discover and practice a skill that can improve your interactions almost immediately.",

While there is a lot of training offered on how to improve the delivery process, culture change and mindset shifting, people are not prepared on how to shift their roles. In traditional environments, everyone has a clear job description that explains their function and what they should/shouldnâ€™t do. In a functional role, it is clear from whom to receive the work and where to send it after a certain expertise/skill is applied. In Agile, all these roles change to â€œAgile Team memberâ€. What does a Team member do? What is the job description for this role? How can someone use the previous skills and expertise under this new role? What University Degree do I need to be \"Product Owner\", one of the \"3 Amigos\", \"On-Site Customer\"? And why does everyone talk about collaboration? This session will focus on these questions. I will talk about the Roles in Agile, how to create an Agile Team (T shaped people) out of traditional roles (I shaped people) such a Tester, Business Analyst, Developer, Solution Architect, Database Admin, Business Project Manager, Project Manager, Operations Engineer, etc. I will explain why collaboration is the key that opens a lot of doors for people to use their skills and learn new ones, create roles that do not exist yet and grow professionally. You will also have a chance to participate on an exercise to build an Agile team by using functional roles from traditional environments. You will be the one to decide on these roles, based on the skills required to deliver Value.",

It not only requires a re-evaluation of roles and responsibilities within the team, but an adjustment of deliverables and expectations. I will share 5 tips on how UX professionals and other non-develop team members can be effective at the story level of an agile project. The result: UX and others move from being traditional roadblocks on agile projects to assets for the entire team.",

Today there are almost 300 SPCs internationally and the numbers are growing. But WHY? What IS the Scaled Agile Framework? Is it the best thing it hit agile since The Manifesto? Does it truly help Agile scale to large companies? Is it just more waterfall? Does it get you the right behavior? Is it just a pretty picture? How does this compare to Scum, DAD, and other Agile \"Methodologies?\" Is this Beyond Agile or back to command and control? Holly Bielawa, former Menlo HTA and current Agile Consultant and SPC at Ivar Jacobson International will answer these questions and more in this interactive session.",

      "description":"This session focuses on using Lean measurement practices to forecast and schedule without relying on developer/development team time. The talk introduces Cycle Times (in it's simplest form, the measurement of how long it takes a unit to move through a process), discusses how to collect the data, and introduces various ways of analyzing the data to make more sound, data-backed decisions. Decisions including for example: Team balance/make-up/size, to work size, how to plan for vacations (or other losses of team members). The data also allows for better agility, consumption of change, and the ability to work from a living, growing, and ever-changing backlog without stopping and going for sprints and without sacrificing the ability to forecast and report to executives. We'll cover: - What cycle times (and value streams) are - How to gather the data - How to analyze the data - How to use cycle times to pull story points out of the process and allow developers to focus on what they are best at: Building great products Sub-topics include: - Release planning with cycle times - Team size & design decisions with cycle time data - Capacity planning",

We move timidly because who and how decisions are made on a variety of topics is unclear. Delegation may appear to be â€˜Either I do it, or you do itâ€™. But in truth there are 7 levels of delegating authority. Participants will be introduced to and play Delegation Poker, a fun game to make clear whoâ€™s responsible for what and on what level.

However, the traditional approach to portfolio management â€” which depends upon long-range forecasting and fixed financial controls â€” breaks down as business environments grow more complex, leaving portfolio managers ill-equipped to reap the potential benefits of their Agile programs. In this 90-minute interactive session, John will introduce tools that help portfolio managers not only survive but thrive under conditions of high business uncertainty. Participants will take part in facilitated team-based exercises which will help them gain an understanding of common financial language, real options analysis, the dynamic business case, and how to use risk profiles to determine which financial controls best fit different classes of investments.",
